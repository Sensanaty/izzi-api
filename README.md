This is the reworked API for my parent's website which is currently running on an ancient version of PHP on cPanel that frequently crashes and struggles to deal with the load of 2 entire people requesting CRUD resources about 3 times an hour.

The Vue frontend of the app can be found here: [Sensanaty/izzi-ui](https://github.com/Sensanaty/izzi-ui)
